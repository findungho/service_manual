## Overview
_This is a basic service manual application that manages the factory devices for the maintenance._


## General
- The Service manual implemented by using .Net 6.0. The application was using "UseInMemoryDatabase" from EntityFrameworkCore for development purpose. In production, it can be used different database engines, here I used Mysql Server configuration.
The application includes serveral services:

    + Get all factory devices and sort all related tasks by the Severity and Created date.
    + Get specific factry device by its Id.
    + Add new factory device.
    + Update an existing device by its Id.
    + Delete a factory device based on its Id.
    + Get all tasks that belong to a specific device.
    + Get task by task Id.
    + Add a new task to a specific device.
    + Update an existing task by task Id.
    + Delete an existing task by task Id.
